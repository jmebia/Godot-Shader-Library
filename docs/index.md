# Hey there, welcome to DevKit!

I’m Maiusebi — an indie dev who’s spent way too many hours hunting down shaders, writing GDScript snippets, and figuring out the weird little quirks of Godot. So, I built this DevKit site: a no-fluff, all-in-one Godot developer toolkit packed with stuff I actually use.

So dive in, try stuff out, steal what you want, and make your projects shine. Let’s make some awesome games — faster and a bit more fun.
